## Overview
Hi there. ðŸ˜Š This is an emulator of the Windows 10 Pro version built using just HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (yes, no libraries or frameworks). I decided to build this cause I thought it would be a really good web app project and would help me understand JavaScript concepts more. Feel free to play with it! ðŸ˜€

* Windows Menu bar âœ…

Background images gotten from Windows 10 Pro, using [Lockscreen as wallpaper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lockscreen-as-wallpaper/9nblggh4wr7c#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) app.
Svgs and images downloaded from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), [icon8](https://icons8.com/), and Windows 10 (used the snip & sketch for the recycle bin cause the svg wasn't available online **hides in shame** ðŸ˜…).
